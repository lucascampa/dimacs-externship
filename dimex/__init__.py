"""
Package for DIMACS externship utilities: preprocessing, model runners, and reporting.

This module aggregates:
- Data preprocessing functions (cleaning, encoding, balancing, splitting).
- Model training and evaluation routines for XGBoost and SPLIT algorithms.
- Reporting tools for visualization of model performance.
