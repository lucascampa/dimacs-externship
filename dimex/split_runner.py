"""
Module for SPLIT algorithm execution and evaluation.

This module provides:
- train_split: Train a SPLIT model with specified hyperparameters, returning the fitted model,
  its decision tree, and training metadata.
- n_leaves: Count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree structure.
- prediction_split: Generate predictions with a trained SPLIT model and compute accuracy.
- binarized_features: Extract human-readable names for binarized features from a trained model.
